# Functor Composition

Ryan Zeigler

---

# Functors - A Recap

--

* Things with a map

--

* `Functor[F[_]] { def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B] }`

--

* Thats it! We're done! 

---

# Some Boilerplate

* You can follow along in a repl and this should work

```tut:silent
import cats._, cats.implicits._
```

---

# Functors Compose

```tut
val F = Functor[List]
val G = Functor[Option]
val H = F.compose(G)

H.map(List(1.some, 2.some))(42 + _)
```

--

* `List` is a Functor

--

* `Option` is a Functor

--

* `Lambda[A => List[Option[A]]]` is, therefore, also a Functor

---

# Lifting

--

* Lets start by looking at a slightly different definition of map

--

```tut:silent
def lift[F[_]: Functor, A, B](f: A => B): F[A] => F[B] = _.map(f)
```

--

* Because of the way Scala works this is somewhat unergonomic. 
* I'm going to use this following definition for the rest of the slides
* They are equivalent but this one has better type inference by using trickery

--

```tut:silent

final class LiftCurry[F[_]](val dummy: Boolean = false) extends AnyVal {
  def apply[A, B](f: A => B)(implicit F: Functor[F]): F[A] => F[B] = _.map(f)
}

def liftF[F[_]]: LiftCurry[F] = new LiftCurry

```

---


# Do You Even Lift Bro?

--

```tut
val add42 = (i: Int) => i + 42
val o42 =  liftF[Option](add42)
val lo42 = liftF[List](o42)
val flo42 = liftF[String => ?](lo42)
```

---

# And Now the Magic

```tut
def ascii(s: String) = {
  s.toList
    .map(_.toInt)
    .map(c => if (c < 256) c.some else none)
}
```

--

```tut
val g = flo42(ascii)
val s = "ðŸ˜€ or ðŸ˜¢"
ascii(s)
g(s)

```

---

# So?

--

* That was cool but what does it by us

--

* Functor instances allow us to lift operations through intermediate wrappers

--

* Applicatives do too but with even more power!

---

# Applicatives

--

* `abstract def ap[A, B](ff: F[(A) â‡’ B])(fa: F[A]): F[B]`

--

* this is part of the Applicative interface (bear in mind no one uses Applicative this way because its unpleasant in scala)

--

```tut
Applicative[Option].ap(add42.pure[Option])(1.some)

Applicative[List].compose[Option].ap(add42.some.pure[List])(List(1.some, 2.some, 3.some))


val add43 = (i: Int) => i + 42 // Because why not...
Applicative[List].compose[Option].ap(List(add42.some, none, add43.some))(List(1.some, 2.some, 3.some))
```

---

# Herein Lies Power

```tut

1 |+| 2

def add[M: Monoid](i: M)(j: M) = i |+| j

val f = (add[Int] _).pure[Option].pure[Either[String, ?]]

val ap1 = Applicative[Either[String, ?]].compose[Option].ap(f)(42.some.asRight)
val ap2 = Applicative[Either[String, ?]].compose[Option].ap(ap1)(42.some.asRight)
```

--

```tut
42.asRight |+| 100.asRight

42.asRight[String] |+| Left("explode")
```

---

# Remarks

--

* For lots of things we can just ignore intermediate layers for tons of stuff and just work in terms of 'pure' values 

--

* Lifting functions is how we can do that (see also mapN in cats which is a nicer version of what I did previously)
